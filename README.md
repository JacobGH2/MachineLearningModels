All Python source files can be run either locally or in a Jupyter/Google Colab notebook.
Execution may be expensive, especially for convolutional models, so reports have been included for all source files showing output/performance.

Convolutional models were trained on a Google Colab NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU instance.
